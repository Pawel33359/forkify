This project was made with help of online course on Udemy called "The Complete JavaScript Course 2022: From Zero to Expert!" made by Jonas Schmedtmann. 
To this project I added on my own: page number on search, validating ingredients when creating new recipies, adding and deleting ingredient fields when creating a new recipe.
To run this project type in terminal: npm start.
